# TinyPlantHomes
## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the conditions of this hackathon and how they align with our interests. We were set on doing a hardware hack but due to the blizzard we were not able to leave our houses to get parts. To complete this project we had to use only the hardware we had in our house and make due.
## What it does
Our project is a miniature greenhouse made to require less energy that how a person would conventionally grow plants in their house. While it is centered around taking advantage of hardware its main focus is sustainability so we wanted to find creative ways to solve problems instead of just throwing stronger electronics at it.
## How we built it
The project consist of a small form factor PC case as the housing, PC fans to deal with circulation and heating, an LCD screen, some sensors and and Arduino to control everything.
## Challenges we ran into
Lack of available parts- half of the sensors we tested were broken or broke after testing due faulty wiring, also Boston is under 2 feet of snow
Voltage problems- some parts required higher voltages to use and we needed to learn about how we could boost voltage to use some parts
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finding a way to water plants by taking advantage of physics instead of using motors
## What we learned
How to use new sensors, how to grow plants, how to edit videos
